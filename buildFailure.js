This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message is not particularly helpful, often mentioning something about an Android build failing without specific details.  Debugging can be challenging because the underlying cause isn't immediately apparent.  The build process might stop abruptly with no clear indication of the failure point or the reason behind it.
