The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Check Android SDK Setup:** Ensure the Android SDK is properly installed and configured. Verify that the necessary build tools and platforms are available. 
2. **Clean Build Cache:** Use `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the existing build cache before attempting a fresh build.  This helps eliminate any cached artifacts that may be causing conflicts. 
3. **Inspect Dependencies:** Scrutinize the project's dependencies, looking for any packages that might be causing incompatibility or conflicts. Try updating or downgrading versions of suspect packages. 
4. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:**  Ensure you're using the latest stable versions of the Expo CLI and SDK. Outdated versions can often contain bugs that have been addressed in newer releases. 
5. **Verify Configuration:** Double-check the configuration files (e.g., `app.json`, `android/app/build.gradle`) for any typos or errors that could be affecting the build process. 

If the problem persists after these steps, provide additional context, such as the full output from `expo prebuild`, the versions of your Expo CLI and SDK, and your project's dependency list. This additional information will aid in further debugging.
